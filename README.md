# Unemployment-forecasting
This is project was made as part of completing the course in forecasting and simulation. 
we have made an attempt to predict unemployment level based on data from GUS.
 Many different time series models were estimated, and ultimately Winters' multiplicative model was found to be the best.
 The calculations were performed in Excel, the capabilities of which were extended to include functions derived from the r language.
The BERT software made it possible.
To run some functions used in spreadsheets it is necessary to install BERT, then in the BERT console install gap library and replace original functions.r with version included in this repo.
